# NiosIIAssembly
Small challenges and useful libraries programmed in assembly for the Altera Nios II FPGA processor, mostly solutions to [Project Euler] [https://projecteuler.net] problems.

## Using this Project
If you would like to run any of the code in this project in a virtual environement, visit the
[CPUlator webpage] [https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=nios-de0]. Note that this web app only performs functional simulation, not timing simulation.

If you would like more info on the Nios II instruction set, visit [Intel's webpage] [https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/nios2/n2cpu_nii51017.pdf] for an instruction set reference.
